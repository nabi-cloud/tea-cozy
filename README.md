## Project Overview
Tea Cozy is a fictional virtual tea shop, created as a part of the required Codecademy projects. The aim of this project is to design and build a website for a tea shop using the provided design spec. This project aims to demonstrate my web development skills, particularly in CSS flexbox to accommodate different screen sizes.

<br>
This design spec is provided by Codecademy.

## Project Requirements
The main focus of this project is to utilize **flexbox** for creating a responsive layout.

To achieve a responsive design with flexbox, the following was implemented:

- Organize the website's layout into flexible containers and items.
- Use flexbox properties to distribute space, align items, and create a consistent flow of content.
- Implement media queries to apply specific styles based on different screen sizes, optimizing the website for various devices.

## Going the Extra Mile: Organized CSS
Created a CSS codebase that is easy to manage and extend, allowing myself or other developers to work efficiently and contribute to the project seamlessly. I have organized the CSS file into different sections to maintain a clean and manageable codebase. The CSS file follows the following structure:

1. **Global Styles:** Contains styles that apply globally to the entire website, such as the background, color schemes, and box-sizing rules.

2. **Typography Styles:** Includes styles related to fonts, font sizes, line heights, and any text-related properties.

3. **Structure Styles:** Handles the layout and positioning of major structural elements of the main content area.

4. **Module Styles:** Houses styles for reusable components or elements like the header, navigation bar, and footer.

5. **Page Styles:** Contains specific styles for each section of the site, targeting unique elements and layout adjustments as needed.

## Reflection
As with any project, I encountered moments where the outcome did not meet my initial expectations. However, these perceived setbacks became valuable opportunities to hone my problem-solving skills as a developer.

At times, the layout appeared misaligned or distorted on certain devices. Through research and experimentation, I identified the areas that needed adjustment and gradually refined the responsive design.

I realized the importance of resilience and patience in problem-solving. It is natural for projects to encounter roadblocks, but learning to persevere and approach issues with a problem-solving mindset is crucial.

In cases where I encountered problems that was detrimental to my productivity, I sought guidance from professionals in web development communities and forums. Reaching out for help not only expanded my knowledge but also exposed me to alternative perspectives and solutions.
